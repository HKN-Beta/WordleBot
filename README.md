# WordleBot

(yeah I have way too much time on my hands and have a procrastination problem)

This bot scrapes Wordle score messages as they arrive in the Slack #wordle channel, adds accrued points to the user's total at a score page.  That's pretty much it.

This assumes people will be honest but... oh well.
